Thanks: This package was developed as a project for the Google Summer of Code
    2014. I would like to thank Google for financial support and the R project
    for Statistical Computing for endorsing this project. My thanks also go out
    to Kris Boudt, Jonathan Cornelissen and Daniele Signori, who acted as my
    mentors during this Google Summer of Code. Thanks also to Roland Fried, for
    kindly making his R code available, which has been helpful in the
    implementation of his piecewise constant volatility method in this package.
